## üìò PDF Question Answering Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered chatbot that can read, understand, and answer questions from your PDF documents. It combines LangChain, Cohere embeddings & LLMs, and Pinecone vector database to provide intelligent document retrieval and conversational Q&A.

## üöÄ Features
-Load and process multiple PDF documents.  
-Split large documents into smaller, overlapping text chunks for better context retrieval.  
-Store and query embeddings in Pinecone  
-Ask natural language questions and get answers directly from your documents  
-Powered by LangChain + Cohere  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
-LangChain: framework  
-Cohere: Embeddings + LLM  
-Pinecone: Vector database  
-Python: programming language
